# SmartSums

The aim of this repository is to make the codes, benchmarks etc available that we refer to in our publications about Sum Logic/SmartSums.

The folders so far correspond to the tables presented in our CAV21 paper "Summing up Smart Transitions", where total_nototal refers to table 3, overview_table refers to table 4 and arith_examples to table 5.
The instructions.txt document provides detailed information on how to run the code.
